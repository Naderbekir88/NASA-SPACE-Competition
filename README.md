Landslides occur in all 50 states. Causing between 25 and 50 deaths every year in the US alone and thousands more in vulnerable areas around the globe. Landslides include debris avalanches, debris flows down carrying large rocks, block movements causing huge damage and loss to people, their homes, farms and cattle, industrial and other structures. Our project detects landslides' whereabouts and predicts their level of risk, potential casualties, and the cost of their impacts. Using a user-friendly website &amp;machine learning model trained on data from NASA satellites and ground-based sources. providing affected communities and governments with the information needed for timely decision-making.
